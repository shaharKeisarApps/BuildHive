# BuildHive

BuildHive is a decentralized build server that empowers developers to build and deploy their software projects with enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency. It leverages blockchain technology and distributed computing to create a resilient and trustworthy build infrastructure.

## Key Features (MVP)

*   **Decentralized Builds:** Distribute build tasks across a network of worker nodes, eliminating single points of failure and enhancing scalability.
*   **Secure Build Execution:** Ensure build integrity and prevent tampering by leveraging cryptographic signing and verification of build artifacts.
*   **Transparent Build Logs:** Store build logs and metadata on a distributed ledger, providing an immutable and auditable record of all build activities.
*   **Token-Based Incentives:** Reward worker nodes for contributing their computing resources to the network, fostering a vibrant and self-sustaining ecosystem.
*   **Simplified Project Onboarding:** Provide an intuitive command-line interface (CLI) and web portal for easy project setup and management.

## Tech Stack

*   **Blockchain:** Ethereum (for smart contracts and tokenization)
*   **Distributed Storage:** IPFS (for storing build artifacts and logs)
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Frontend:** React, Redux
*   **Build Tools:** Docker, Jenkins (or similar)

## MVP Checklist

*   [ ] Smart contract development for tokenomics and build verification
*   [ ] Backend API for project management and build orchestration
*   [ ] Worker node implementation for executing build tasks
*   [ ] Basic CLI for project interaction
*   [ ] Integration with IPFS for artifact storage
*   [ ] Initial documentation and setup guides

## Future Ideas (Post-MVP)

*   Support for multiple programming languages and build systems
*   Advanced security features (e.g., confidential builds, vulnerability scanning)
*   Integration with popular CI/CD platforms
*   Decentralized governance model for platform evolution
*   Marketplace for build services and plugins

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/buildhive.git`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install` (for backend and frontend)
3.  Set up an Ethereum development environment (e.g., Ganache, Hardhat)
4.  Deploy smart contracts to the local network
5.  Configure backend and worker nodes
6.  Start the application: `npm start`
