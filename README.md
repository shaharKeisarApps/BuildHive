# 🐝 BuildHive — Distributed CI Powered by Your Team

**BuildHive** is a developer-first SaaS platform that intelligently offloads heavy CI workloads — like Android or iOS builds — from cloud runners to your team’s own high-performance developer machines (e.g., MacBook Pros), when they’re idle.

BuildHive helps you **reduce CI costs**, **speed up builds**, and **utilize team resources more efficiently** — all with security and control.

## 🚀 Key Features

- ⚡ Offload CI jobs (e.g., Android builds) to local team machines
- 🔁 Auto-detection of high CI load and seamless fallback
- 🧠 Smart coordination and agent selection
- 🔐 Secure, sandboxed local task execution (Docker-based)
- 🛠️ Lightweight agent runs on developer machines
- 🤝 GitHub Actions integration (MVP target)
- 💻 Kotlin Multiplatform architecture for shared logic

## ✅ MVP Checklist

### Phase 1: Coordinator & Agent
- [x] Scaffold OpenSaaS template
- [ ] Ktor coordinator service (REST API, queue, DB)
- [ ] Agent CLI (auth, heartbeat, task execution)
- [ ] Redis/RabbitMQ integration for job queue
- [ ] PostgreSQL schema for jobs and agents

### Phase 2: CI Integration
- [ ] GitHub Actions plugin (send job to BuildHive)
- [ ] Job packaging (zip or Docker context)
- [ ] Artifact + log return to CI step

### Phase 3: Security & Isolation
- [ ] Docker sandboxing on agent
- [ ] Agent-level permission system
- [ ] JWT or API key auth for agents

### Phase 4: Basic Monitoring
- [ ] CLI dashboard or basic Web UI (agent/job status)
- [ ] Logs and artifact management

## 💡 Why BuildHive?

| Problem                                | BuildHive Solution                           |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Long CI build times                    | Offloads to idle developer machines           |
| Expensive hosted runners               | Reduces reliance on cloud infrastructure      |
| Underutilized MacBooks on the team     | Puts idle power to work securely              |
| Teams blocked waiting on builds        | Parallelizes pipeline tasks dynamically       |

## 🧩 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/buildhive.git
cd buildhive
# Follow setup instructions in coordinator/ and agent/ directories
````

## 📈 Future Features

* Historical load analysis and build prediction
* Multi-agent fallback and load splitting
* Multi-CI support (GitLab, CircleCI, Bitrise)
* Web dashboard with admin controls
* Team reward tracking system (credits per agent usage)

## 🧠 Philosophy

BuildHive is built on the belief that **developer machines are incredibly powerful — and usually underused**. With the right orchestration and security, we can harness that power to improve builds, save money, and move faster.
